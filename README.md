# Machine Learning Portfolio ðŸ’¥
This is a repository of the projects I have worked on, currently working on and my new learnings.

# About Me
I am a masters graduate and deep learning engineer who is currently looking for full-time opportunities as my next challenge. I have worked on many AI projects (most of them are displayed here). I like innovating, brainstorming and itegrating the classical and trending AI methods to a more practical use case. Since, academic data and real world data is very different, which creates a gap for further innovation and adptability. Working on such projects is very thrilling for me as an engineer. 

## Work in progress!
These are the Machine Learning based projects that I am currently working on (under an organisation or personal).
- [Range Error Estimation](https://github.com/ayush939/DNN-based-ranging-quality-prediction-): This project is my master thesis at Sony, Germany. The aim is use an AI-based predictive model to increase the robustness and accuracy of the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based ranging device which is further used for indoor localization of the objects.
    - The aim is to develop a small, efficient, and robust regression based neural network model by fusing multimodal data.
    - The data is recorded at the organisation (and not open-source). This brings in challenges like quality and quantity of the data.
    - The noise in data set is very challenging as it is based on the environment (physical) and the devices used.
  
## Previous projects
This section includes the major projects that I have worked on in past (for organisations and personal). These projects are part of the learning curve for me as through these projects I got to implement and test my own ideas as solutions to the problems. I was exposed to more practical side of ML which has further motivated me to become an ML Engineer.

- [PCB Detection from Technical Drawings](https://github.com/ayush939/PCB-Detection-MLOps.git): This is the project which I worked on as an Intern at Bosch Startup called Bosch Copperdot. The aim was to build and deploy a machine learning system (computer vision based) from scratch to count number of PCBs from the customer RFQs. Here are the challenges that I worked on. Checkout the repository to understand my approach to this problem!
    - The dataset was unlabelled and very small.
    - The distribution of test data was unknown/unclear.

- [Eye Gaze Data Poisoning](https://github.com/ayush939/Gaze-Data-Poisoning.git): I was associated with University Of Stuttgart, Germany for this project. The aim of the project was to analyse the vulnerabilty and robustness of the eye gaze estimation Computer Vision model which has critical application in privacy and security related domains. We added various types of adversarial noise during the training time and analysed the degradation in model's performance on clean images. We also explored the defence mechanisms.
