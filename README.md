# Machine Learning Portfolio ðŸ’¥
This is a repository of the projects I have worked on, currently working on and my new learnings.

# About Me
I am a masters graduate and deep learning engineer who is currently looking for full-time opportunities as my next challenge. I have worked on many AI projects (most of them are displayed here). I like innovating, brainstorming and itegrating the classical and trending AI methods to a more practical use case. Since, academic data and real world data is very different, which creates a gap for further innovation and adptability. Working on such projects is very thrilling for me as an engineer. 

## Work in progress!
These are the Machine Learning based projects that I am currently working on (under an organisation or personal).
- [Range error estimation](https://github.com/ayush939/DNN-based-ranging-quality-prediction-): This project is my master thesis at Sony, Germany. The aim is use an AI-based predictive model to increase the robustness and accuracy of the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based ranging device. The developed model predicts/estimats and then corrects the ranging error using neural networks for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based ranging device and this device is further used for indoor localization of the objects.
    - The aim is to develop a small, efficient, and robust regression based neural network model by fusing multimodal data.
    - The data is recorded at the organisation. This brings in challenges like quality and quantity of the data.
    - The noise in data set is very challenging as it is based on the environment (physical) and the device used.
  
## Previous projects
This section includes the major projects that I have worked on in past (for organisations and personal). These projects are part of the learning curve for me as through these projects I got to implement and test my own ideas as solutions to the problems. I was exposed to more practical side of ML which has further motivated me to become an ML Engineer.

- [PCB Detection from Technical Drawings](https://github.com/ayush939/PCB-Detection-MLOps.git): This is the project which I worked on as an Intern at Bosch Startup called Bosch Copperdot. The aim was to build and deploy a machine learning system (computer vision based) from scratch to count number of PCBs from the customer RFQs. Here are the challenges that I worked on. Checkout the repository to understand my approach to this problem!
    - The dataset was unlabelled and very small.
    - The distribution of test data was unknown/unclear.

- [Eye Gaze Data Poisoning]():
