# Machine Learning Portfolio ðŸ’¥
This is a repository of the projects I have worked on, currently working on and my new learnings.

I am a masters graduate and deep learning engineer who is currently looking for full-time opportunities as my next challenge. I have worked on many AI projects (most of them are displayed here). I like innovating, brainstorming and itegrating the classical and trending AI methods to a more practical use case. Since, academic data and real world data is very different, which creates a gap for further innovation and adptability. Working on such projects is very thrilling for me as an engineer. 

## Work in progress
These are the Machine Learning based tasks that I am currently working on (under an organisation or personal).
- [Range error estimation](https://github.com/ayush939/DNN-based-ranging-quality-prediction-): This project is my master thesis at Sony, Germany. It is about predicting/estimating and then correcting the ranging error using neural networks for   Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based ranging device and this device is further used for indoor localization of the objects.
